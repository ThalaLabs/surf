# How to upgrade the version

- Run `pnpm run changeset` and provide a description of your change.
- Commit the `.md` file generated by `changeset` along with your code changes, then create the PR.
- After your PR merged, Github Workflow will create a PR called "Version Packages" to update the version in `package.json` and the `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Once the "Version Packages" PR is merged, Github Workflow will publish a new version to NPM.

# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)
