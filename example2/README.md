Surf is a type safe tool for Move contracts in TypeScript environment. [Learn more about Surf on the doc](https://aptos.dev/en/build/sdks/ts-sdk/type-safe-contract#what-is-surf).

We built a simple message board contract that allows anyone to read and write message to the board. Note: message can be overwritten by anyone. It demonstrate how the type safety is provided by Surf.
